# How to Play Wairdle

Wairdle is a fun, word-guessing game inspired by 20 Questions and Wordle, where you try to guess a secret word in 7 questions or fewer. It’s a mental challenge that tests your deduction and creativity, perfect for word lovers and puzzle enthusiasts!

## Game Setup
- **The Word**: The game host (a person or AI like Grok) chooses a secret English word. By default, it’s a noun, but in “Mixed Mode,” it can be any part of speech (e.g., verb, adjective).
- **Word Length**: The host reveals the word’s length upfront (e.g., “It’s a 5-letter noun: _ _ _ _ _”) unless you choose “Mystery Mode,” where the length is hidden.
- **Questions**: You have up to 7 questions to guess the word, inspired by the “six degrees of separation” concept. Questions can be yes/no (e.g., “Is it a living thing?”), open-ended (e.g., “What’s it used for?”), or specific guesses (e.g., “Is it a pencil?”).
- **Goal**: Guess the word in as few questions as possible!

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: The host announces the word’s details (e.g., “It’s a 5-letter noun”). If playing in Mixed Mode, they’ll note if it’s not a noun. In Mystery Mode, no length is given.
2. **Ask Questions**: Ask up to 7 questions to narrow down the word. You can ask:
   - Yes/no questions (e.g., “Is it tangible?”)
   - Descriptive questions (e.g., “What’s a common use for it?”)
   - Direct guesses (e.g., “Is it a table?”)
   The host answers clearly, with more specific questions yielding more detailed answers.
3. **Visual Aid**: The host provides a visual like “_ _ _ _ _” for a 5-letter word, which may update if you learn specific letters (e.g., “S _ _ _ _” if the first letter is revealed).
4. **Free Hint**: You can request one free hint per game, like the word’s category (e.g., “It’s a physical object”) or the first letter. Ask for it anytime!
5. **Guess the Word**: Use your questions to deduce the word. If you guess correctly or use all 7 questions, the host reveals the word and the game ends.

## Game Modes
- **Standard Mode**: The word is a noun, and the length is revealed (e.g., “6-letter noun: _ _ _ _ _ _”).
- **Mixed Mode**: The word can be any part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), with length revealed unless you choose Mystery Mode.
- **Mystery Mode**: The word length is hidden, increasing the challenge. You can use a question to ask about length (e.g., “Is it longer than 5 letters?”).

## Scoring (Optional)
- Earn points based on how few questions you use:
  - 1 question: 10 points
  - 2-3 questions: 8 points
  - 4-5 questions: 6 points
  - 6-7 questions: 4 points
  - Bonus: +2 points if you guess without using all 7 questions.
- Track your score across rounds for bragging rights!

## Tips for Success
- Start broad with yes/no questions to narrow the field (e.g., “Is it a physical object?” or “Is it alive?”).
- Use descriptive questions to gather context (e.g., “Who typically uses it?”).
- Save your free hint for when you’re stuck or want to confirm a hunch.
- Think about the word length and visual aid to guide your guesses.
- Be creative—specific questions can unlock detailed clues!

## Example Round
- **Host**: “It’s a 5-letter noun: _ _ _ _ _.”
- **Player Q1**: “Is it a tangible object?” **Host**: “Yes.”
- **Player Q2**: “Is it found indoors?” **Host**: “Usually, yes.”
- **Player Q3**: “What’s it used for?” **Host**: “It’s commonly used for writing.”
- **Player Q4**: “Is it a pen?” **Host**: “No, but close! It’s another writing tool.”
- **Player Q5**: “Is it a pencil?” **Host**: “Yes, you got it in 5 questions! Score: 6 points.”
